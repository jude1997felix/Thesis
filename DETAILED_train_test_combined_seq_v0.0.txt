and you look at the United Kingdom	I-contin I-contin I-contin I-contin I-contin I-contin I-contin
the	B-size

it has a circle	B-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape
area that is part of the country as well	I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape
when you're looking at all of those countries	I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape I-shape
in that area	I-shape I-shape I-shape
it is	B-dir I-dir
somewhat near it borders Romania if you know where that is it's south of Hungary	I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir I-dir
